# ODC-Seq2Seq 🚀

A web-based deep learning project that demonstrates sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text generation using an encoder-decoder architecture, developed as part of the **AI and Data Science Scholarship** from **Orange Digital Center** in collaboration with **Amit Learning**.


👉 **Live App**: [Streamlit App](https://odc-seq2seq.streamlit.app/)  
📁 **GitHub Repository**: [ODC-Seq2Seq](https://github.com/mohamedhosam4/ODC-Seq2Seq)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)** model using deep learning techniques to process input text and generate relevant output sequences. It's particularly useful in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and chatbot responses.

The app is deployed via [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), offering an interactive interface for users to test the model in real-time.

## 🔧 Features

- 🧾 **Encoder-Decoder architecture** using LSTM layers.
- 📊 **Pre-trained model** available and loaded automatically.
- 📦 Built with **TensorFlow / Keras** and deployed via **Streamlit**.
- 🌐 Accessible UI to interact with the model and generate outputs dynamically.
